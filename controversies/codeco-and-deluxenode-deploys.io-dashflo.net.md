# CodeCo & DeluxeNode/Deploys.io/Dashflo.net

Rihan Arfan, or CodeCo was the creator of DeluxeNode. Wait, no. Deploys.io. Wait, nevermind, it's Dashflo.net now. Perhaps one of the biggest scumbags here, he cheaped out on everything and lied to hell and back about his "owned" hardware.

## DeluxeNode

The company originated as DeluxeNode, and was a new budget hosting provider. Owned by CodeCo and Tim, and registered in the UK. It was okay, and you really did get what you paid for. Unexplained, frequent but easily avoidable downtime, littered with lies and false information. "Owned" hardware was actually Lease To Own \(LTO\) and their "best in class" Voxility DDoS protection was only on some of their systems. Nodes were oversold from the start. CodeCo accused a real chat log, which included numerous examples of his toxicity and denial of his incompetent services, along with short, blunt answers and victimisation of himself of being fake. 

## Deploys.io

CodeCo, David and Tim got bored of the DeluxeNode branding. Or maybe they knew their brand had negativity attached, so they thought of the ingenious idea to just change their name. David bought the "deploys.io" domain, and the company rebranded. A new website theme was integrated, built using Argon Design Kit, although most of the core components of the original example pages for the kit remain present, so it was most likely edited. It didn't change their quality of their brand though. If anything, things got worse. Eventually, after internal disagreements with Rihan's dumbass methods of running Deploys, David and Tim left.

## The drama

David and Tim, both now ex-employees of DeluxeFlo.io had a lot to expose. Rihan is guilty of some of the most frowned upon practices in the hosting industry, most noticably lying about hardware \(e.g: LTO, not owned, and only some nodes had DDoS protection\) and regarding his huge debt. 

## Dashflo.net / The state of Deploys.io

Since David purchased and owned the Deploys.io name and brand, he made the choice, after Rihan's bad practices, to take over the domain and display this page. It exposed the bad practices and behind-the-scenes issues and unprofessional behaviours of Rihan. Both David and Tim are experienced in the hosting industry, and Tim was one of the founders of DashNode.io. Due to Rihan's loss of the domain, he cried. Ignored everyone. Blocked people. The typical "oh, fuck, they know I'm a scum" reaction. He realised he still had debts to pay back to the LTO providers he used that went bankrupt, so he made the amazing choice for another rebrand. Dashflo.net.

## Dashflo.net and the post-"oops, I fucked up"-ness

Dashflo.net is now the home of Deploys.
