# Revenact

Revenact is a forum for users to discuss servers, software, hardware, networking, hosting, system administration and other techy topics. It uses XenForo and has been heavily customised. It's also a store for developers and designers to sell plugins, scripts, and other resources. Founded and managed by [Tommy](tommy.md) in 2019, and still running in 2020. The site can be found here: [https://revenact.io](https://revenact.io) and their Discord server can be found here: [https://discordapp.com/invite/ePsVaYh](https://discordapp.com/invite/ePsVaYh)
