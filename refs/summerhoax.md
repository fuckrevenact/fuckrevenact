# SummerHoax

[https://summerhoax.com/](https://summerhoax.com/) is an open source site to shit talk hosts. "Skid" or "Summer" hosts/hoaxes are hosts operating illegally or by using very bad business practices. 

> "A "Summer Hoax" is a hosting company that someone's trying to start that's usually not a legally registered business, has bad business practices, uses nulled billing systems, or just low effort in general. They usually have an average lifespan of a couple months, and are mostly out to appeal towards the low budget audience \(mostly made of kids\) for hosting in order to make a quick buck or two." ~ summerhoax.com

 The site lists multiple "Certified Summer Hoaxes" 

> "A collection of low quality or illegally operating hosts that I've seen while browsing the internet. I'd recommend avoiding these hosts if possible.

and "Frozen Winter Hoaxes," a list of bad hosts that are no longer in operation. A "Notable Mentions" section lists a selection of users known to be frequently associated with these bad hosts. 

## The Guide

A "guide" can be found on this site. It mocks and pokes fun at a stereotypical SummerHoax creation, and is littered with intentional grammatical and factual errors to add to the comedic intentions of the site. It's almost as much of a joke as [Tommy](tommy.md). The steps show to use a Contabo VPS \(Contabo are known to be a dreadful hosting provider\), set up SWAP \(A technology to use secondary storage media as a supplement for primary storage, aka. RAM\), install nulled WHMCS \(A paid billing solution\), download black-market WHMCS templates, use a parents bank card, and other dangerous practices. The guide is **not** intended to be followed, and can lead in catastrophe if it is followed.

### Open Source

The site is open source, therefore anyone is able to suggest modifications and changes to the code, which allows people to recommend hosts that should be added to the SummerHoax list.
